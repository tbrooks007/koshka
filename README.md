Koshka aka BitsBlog Service is a light weight .Net 4.0 / MVC.NET based open source blogging service that will manage content, user management and API authentication. The service leaves the interface / GUI management to another service to be created and managed by the user. This design allows for easily injecting content into any application container such as a website or mobile applications with a simple RESTful API call.  API authentication is currently implemented using a symmetric key pair.  

** This project is a proof of concept application and is not under active development.
